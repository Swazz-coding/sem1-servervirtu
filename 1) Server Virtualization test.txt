1) Server Virtualization


Server virtualization is the process through which a physical server is divided into multiple unique and isolated virtual servers by means of a software application. Each virtual server can have its own operating system and can run independently. These operating systems are called as guest operating systems and these virtual operating systems are running on another operating systems known as host operating systems.  Each guest operating systems running in this manner is independent and unaware of any other guests running on the same host. Different virtualization techniques are employed to achieve this transparency. 

A hypervisor, also known as a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), is a key component of server virtualization. It stores and configures the physical resources of a virtual machine, separating them from each other and from the underlying hardware. Popular hypervisors include VMware vSphere/ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V and KVM.

Physical Server Hardware: A host server, also known as a physical server, is the actual piece of hardware that runs the hypervisor and hosts many virtual machines. The server must have sufficient computing power, memory, storage, and networking capabilities to meet the estimated demand for virtual machines.

CPU (Central Processing Unit): Modern CPUs often include hardware support for virtualization, such as Intel VT-x or AMD-V. This generation improves the overall performance and performance of digital machines via way of means of permitting the hypervisor to delegate sure virtualization responsibilities to the CPU.


Memory (RAM): Adequate RAM is needed for server virtualization. Each digital system makes use of a part of the host server's reminiscence to function its working device and applications. Insufficient reminiscence can motive overall performance deterioration and boom the chance of aid opposition amongst digital machines.

Storage: Virtual machines want garage for his or her working systems, applications, and data. Storage alternatives consist of nearby drives, SAN (Storage Area Network), NAS (Network Attached Storage), and different garage solutions. Disk I/O overall performance is an vital challenge in virtualized setups.

Network Infrastructure: A sturdy community infrastructure is critical for communique among digital machines, in addition to for outside connectivity.
Communication between virtual machines and external connections requires a robust network infrastructure. The host server must have enough network ports and the network switches must be able to handle the traffic generated by multiple virtual machines.

Virtualization management software allows system administrators to create, configure, monitor, and manage virtual machines. This program is critical for optimizing resource usage, monitoring performance, and ensuring the overall health of a virtualized system.


Backup and recovery solutions: Because multiple virtual machines share the same physical hardware, effective backup and recovery solutions are critical to prevent data loss and ensure business continuity.

2) Deployment question

Deployment Details:

I deployed a virtual machine named "Lastname-VM-Test-1" on the production network, specifically VLAN_01.

Deployment Strategy Explanation:

For this deployment, I opted to use a pre-configured template. The decision to use a template was driven by the need for a standardized and efficient deployment process. Templates offer a quick and streamlined way to replicate a consistent environment, ensuring uniformity across multiple instances. This is particularly advantageous when deploying virtual machines with similar configurations for scalability or when maintaining a standardized infrastructure is a priority.

Considerations for Resources:

CPU Allocation: The virtual machine was allocated four virtual CPUs to meet the processing demands of the anticipated workload. This allocation strikes a balance between performance and resource utilization, ensuring efficient handling of tasks.

Network Configuration: Placing the VM on the production network, VLAN_01, was a deliberate choice to integrate it seamlessly into the existing infrastructure. This ensures the virtual machine has the necessary network connectivity and can communicate with other devices on the production network.

RAM Assignment: Considering the memory requirements of the operating system and applications, I allocated 8 GB of RAM to the VM. This provides sufficient memory resources for optimal performance without risking resource contention.

Storage Provisioning: The virtual machine was provisioned with a 100 GB virtual hard disk using high-performance SSD storage. This accommodates the OS, applications, and potential data growth while ensuring fast disk I/O performance.

Network Addressing:

The VM was assigned the IP address 192.168.1.10 within VLAN_01. The gateway address was set to 192.168.1.1 to facilitate communication with other devices on the production network. This addressing scheme aligns with the existing network infrastructure, ensuring proper connectivity.
